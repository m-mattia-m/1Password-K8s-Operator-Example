# 1Password Kubernetes Operator Example

This repository contains a small example to check the 1Password Kubernetes Operator. For more information about how this
operator works you could find on the official 1Password documentation:
[1Password docs](https://developer.1password.com/docs/k8s/operator/).

It is possible to use the operator to manage secrets in Kubernetes. The operator will create a secret in the Kubernetes
cluster. Therefore, you can create secrets and map them to Kubernetes secrets or into config maps.
